                    <h3>Understanding Property Searches</h3>
                    <p>Property searches reveal important information about the property including planning restrictions, environmental issues, infrastructure charges, and any other matters that could affect your purchase. These searches help protect you from unexpected issues and help ensure you're making an informed decision. We will discuss with you if there are any additional searches that should be considered.</p>

                    <h3>What's Included in Our Service</h3>
                    <p>The agreed flat fee covers all standard conveyancing work including:</p>

                    <h3>When to Engage a Lawyer</h3>
                    <p>Engage a lawyer as soon as you're serious about buying or selling property. Early engagement allows us to prepare and/or review contracts, advise on terms and conditions, and ensure you're fully informed throughout the transaction process.</p>

                    <h3>The Conveyancing Timeline</h3>
                    <p>Typical conveyancing takes 8-12 weeks from contract signing to settlement, depending on factors like mortgage approval times, search results, and whether there's a chain of property sales and purchases involved. We work efficiently to meet your desired settlement timeframes while ensuring all legal requirements are satisfied.</p>

                    <h3>What Happens at Settlement?</h3>
                    <p>Settlement is when ownership officially transfers. We handle all settlement documents, coordinate with banks and other parties, ensure funds are properly transferred, and arrange for keys to be released. You'll receive confirmation once settlement is complete and the property is legally yours.</p>

                    <h3>Common Property Issues We Navigate</h3>
                    <ul class="service-list">
