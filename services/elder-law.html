                    <h4>Attorney Misconduct and Abuse of Power</h4>
                    <p>When someone holds Power of Attorney, they must act in your best interests. We take action when attorneys:</p>
                    <ul class="service-list">
                        <li>Misuse funds or assets for their own benefit</li>

                    <h4>Fraud and Undue Influence Claims</h4>
                    <p>Older people can be subject to fraud, scams, and undue influence. We assist with:</p>

                    <h4>Proprietary Estoppel Claims</h4>
                    <p>If someone promised you property or an interest in property, and you relied on that promise to your detriment, you may have a claim. We handle cases involving:</p>

                        <li>Promises of inheritance in exchange for care or support</li>

                    <h4>Constructive Trust and Resulting Trust Claims</h4>
                    <p>In certain circumstances, courts can recognise equitable interests in property despite lack of formal documentation. We advise on:</p>

                        <li>Recovery of property held by others for your benefit</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Property Adjustment Claims</h3>
                    <p>Various legal mechanisms exist to adjust property interests and recover compensation when informal arrangements or assumptions prove incorrect.</p>

                    <h4>Family Provision Claims</h4>
