                    <h3>Our Transparent Fee Structure</h3>
                    <p>We are committed to transparent and "no surprises" approach to our pricing, thereby providing you with fair and predictable costs. Accordingly, our fees and charges will be discussed and agreed with you.</p>
                    <p>In NSW we are not permitted to charge fees based on a percentage of the value of the estate. For the initial stages of an estate administration the Court regulates what we may charge. For work carried out beyond the initial stage we are only permitted to charge a fair and reasonable fee. What is fair and reasonable varies depending on the complexity of the estate and any issues that may arise. This is why we believe in transparent pricing. We will discuss our fees with you during your consultation and reach an agreement with you about them. This ensures you pay for the work actually performed and there are no surprises.</p>

                    <h3>Your Responsibilities as Executor</h3>
                    <p>As an executor, you're responsible for identifying, locating, gathering and valuing assets, paying debts and taxes, and distributing the estate according to the will. This includes obtaining probate, lodging tax returns, and keeping detailed records. We explain and guide executors through each step and handle the legal complexities and logistics for you.</p>

                    <h3>Understanding the Probate Process</h3>
                    <p>Probate is the Court based legal process of validating a will and granting authority to the executor or administrator to collect, administer and finalise the deceased's estate. It's required when someone dies leaving assets in their sole name, such as real estate, bank accounts, or shares. Assets held jointly don't require probate.</p>

                    <h3>Timeframes</h3>
                    <p>Probate timeframes vary depending on the complexity of the estate and court processing times. Simple estates may take 6-8 weeks for probate approval, while complex estates might take several months. The full estate administration process typically takes between 6-12 months to complete.</p>
