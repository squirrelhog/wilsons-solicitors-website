                <p class="intro-text">Expert representation in estate disputes and will challenges including family provision claims, both challenging the Will for eligible beneficiaries or defending the Will against such a challenge for the Executor/Administrator.</p>

                <div class="service-features">
                    <h3>Strategic Approach to Estate Disputes</h3>
                    <p>We aim to resolve Will disputes through negotiation / mediation wherever possible, but provide strong court representation when necessary to protect your interests. Our experienced team understands the emotional and financial toll of estate disputes and works to achieve the best outcome efficiently.</p>

                    <h3>Family Provision Claims</h3>
                    <p>If you've been left out of a will or received inadequate provision, you may be eligible to make a family provision claim. We represent both claimants seeking provision and executors defending estates against claims.</p>

                    <h4>Who Can Make a Family Provision Claim?</h4>
                    <p>Under NSW law, the following people may be eligible:</p>
                    <ul class="service-list">
                        <li>Current spouse or de facto partner</li>
                        <li>Former spouse or de facto partner (in certain circumstances)</li>
                        <li>Children of the deceased (including adopted and step-children)</li>
                        <li>Persons who were wholly or partly dependent on the deceased</li>
                        <li>Persons in a close personal relationship with the deceased</li>
                        <li>Grandchildren who were dependent on the deceased</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Challenging the Validity of a Will</h3>
                    <p>A will can be challenged on various grounds, including:</p>
                    <ul class="service-list">
                        <li><strong>Lack of Testamentary Capacity</strong> - The will-maker didn't understand what they were doing</li>
                        <li><strong>Undue Influence</strong> - Someone pressured the will-maker to make or change their will</li>
                        <li><strong>Fraud or Forgery</strong> - The will or signature is not genuine</li>
                        <li><strong>Improper Execution</strong> - The will wasn't signed or witnessed correctly</li>
                        <li><strong>Suspicious Circumstances</strong> - Unusual circumstances surrounding the will's creation</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Executor and Beneficiary Disputes</h3>
                    <p>We handle disputes between:</p>
                    <ul class="service-list">

                        <li>Beneficiaries and executors over estate administration</li>
                        <li>Co-executors who cannot agree on decisions</li>
                        <li>Family members disputing ownership of assets</li>

                    <h3>Defending Estate Claims</h3>
                    <p>If you're an executor facing a claim against the estate, we provide strong defense strategies including:</p>

                    <h3>Time Limits for Estate Claims</h3>
                    <p><strong>Critical:</strong> Strict time limits apply to estate disputes:</p>
                    <ul class="service-list">
                        <li>Family provision claims must be made within 12 months of death</li>
                        <li>Extensions may be granted but are not guaranteed</li>
                        <li>Will validity challenges have different time considerations</li>

                    </ul>

                    <h3>Mediation and Alternative Dispute Resolution</h3>
                    <p>Court proceedings can be expensive and emotionally draining. We prioritize resolution through:</p>

                        <li>Settlement conferences</li>
                        <li>Without prejudice negotiations</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>These approaches often achieve better outcomes faster and with less cost than court proceedings.</p>

                    <h3>Court Representation</h3>
                    <p>When court action is necessary, we provide experienced representation in:</p>
