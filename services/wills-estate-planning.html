                    <h3>Why Choose Our Visual Will System?</h3>
                    <p>Our innovative approach sets us apart from other Australian lawyers. During your appointment, you'll see your will being created on a large screen presentation, allowing you to:</p>
                    <ul class="service-list">
                        <li>Understand every clause and provision in real-time</li>
                        <li>Make immediate changes and see their effect</li>
                        <li>Ask questions as your will is being drafted</li>
                        <li>Leave with complete confidence in your estate planning</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>The Importance of Professional Will Preparation</h3>
                    <p>While DIY will kits might seem convenient, they carry significant risks. Improper execution, unclear language, or failure to meet legal requirements can make your will invalid or lead to unintended consequences which can be time consuming and costly to rectify. Our professional legal advice ensures your will is properly drafted, executed, and legally sound.</p>

                    <h3>When to Update Your Will</h3>
                    <p>We recommend reviewing your will every 3-5 years or after major life events such as:</p>
                    <ul class="service-list">
                        <li>Marriage or divorce</li>
                        <li>Birth of children or grandchildren</li>
                        <li>Significant changes in assets</li>
                        <li>Death of a beneficiary or executor</li>
                        <li>Moving interstate or overseas</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Transparent Fixed-Fee Pricing</h3>
                    <p>Our will preparation services use transparent, agreed fixed-fee pricing so you know exactly what to expect. Costs will vary depending on complexity, but we believe everyone should have access to proper estate planning. Contact us for a no-obligation quote tailored to your specific needs.</p>
