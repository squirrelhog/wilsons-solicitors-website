                    <div class="faq-question">Do I really need a will?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Absolutely you should. Without a valid will, NSW intestacy laws determine how your assets are distributed, which may not align with your wishes. A will allows you to provide for your loved ones according to your intentions and can significantly reduce stress and costs for your family during an already difficult time.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Our interactive visual presentation system allows you to see your will being created in real-time during your appointment. Led by our experienced Principal, David Wilson, you'll fully understand and approve every aspect of your will before signing. This ensures complete confidence and eliminates confusion.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">How often should I update my will?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Review your will every 3-5 years or after major life events such as marriage, divorce, birth of children, significant asset changes, or moving interstate. We recommend keeping your will up to date to ensure it reflects your current circumstances and wishes.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>While legally possible, DIY wills carry significant risks. Improper execution, unclear language, or failure to meet other legal requirements can make your will invalid or lead to unintended consequences which can be time consuming and costly to try and rectify. Professional legal advice from a firm that is focussed on Wills and Estates ensures your will is properly drafted, executed, and legally sound.</p>

                    <div class="faq-question">What happens if I don't have a will?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>If you die without a valid will (intestate), NSW law determines how your assets are distributed. This may not reflect your wishes and can result in lengthy, expensive court processes. Your spouse and children receive assets according to a predetermined formula, regardless of your actual intentions.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Our will preparation services use transparent, agreed fixed-fee pricing so you know exactly what to expect. Costs will vary depending on complexity, but we believe everyone should have access to proper estate planning. Contact us for a no-obligation quote tailored to your specific needs.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What is probate and when is it required?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Probate is the Court based legal process of validating a will and granting authority to the executor or administrator to collect, administer and finalise the deceased's estate. It's required when someone dies leaving assets in their sole name, such as real estate, bank accounts, or shares. Assets held jointly don't require probate.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">How long does probate take?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Probate timeframes vary depending on the complexity of the estate and court processing times. Simple estates may take 6-8 weeks for probate approval, while complex estates might take several months. The full estate administration process typically takes between 6-12 months to complete.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Why don't you charge percentage-based fees?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>In NSW we are not permitted to charge fees based on a percentage of the value of the estate. For the initial stages of an estate administration the Court regulates what we may charge. For work carried out beyond the initial stage we are only permitted to charge a fair and reasonable fee. What is fair and reasonable varies depending on the complexity of the estate and any issues that may arise. This is why we believe in transparent pricing. We will discuss our fees with you during your consultation and reach an agreement with you about them. This ensures you pay for the work actually performed and there are no surprises.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What are my responsibilities as an executor?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>As an executor, you're responsible for identifying, locating, gathering and valuing assets, paying debts and taxes, and distributing the estate according to the will. This includes obtaining probate, lodging tax returns, and keeping detailed records. We explain and guide executors through each step and handle the legal complexities and logistics for you.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes, we regularly assist executors and administrators with estates involving assets located interstate or overseas. Our experience includes coordinating with foreign solicitors, navigating different legal systems, and ensuring compliance with international requirements.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What does conveyancing involve?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Conveyancing is the legal process of transferring property ownership from seller to buyer. It involves contract preparation and review, property searches, mortgage coordination, settlement arrangements, and ensuring all legal requirements are met for a valid transfer of title.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">How long does conveyancing take?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Typical conveyancing takes 8-12 weeks from contract signing to settlement, depending on factors like mortgage approval times, search results, and whether there's a chain of property sales and purchases involved. We work efficiently to meet your desired settlement timeframes while ensuring all legal requirements are satisfied.</p>
                    </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What are conveyancing searches and why are they important?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Property searches reveal important information about the property including planning restrictions, environmental issues, infrastructure charges, and any other matters that could affect your purchase. These searches help protect you from unexpected issues and help ensure you're making an informed decision. We will discuss with you if there are any additional searches that should be considered.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>The agreed flat fee covers all standard conveyancing work including contract review, property searches, liaison with banks and other parties, preparation of settlement documents, and attendance at settlement. You'll know the exact cost upfront with no hidden charges or surprise fees.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Engage a lawyer as soon as you're serious about buying or selling property. Early engagement allows us to prepare and/or review contracts, advise on terms and conditions, and ensure you're fully informed throughout the transaction process.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What happens at settlement?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Settlement is when ownership officially transfers. We handle all settlement documents, coordinate with banks and other parties, ensure funds are properly transferred, and arrange for keys to be released. You'll receive confirmation once settlement is complete and the property is legally yours.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>A General Power of Attorney is temporary and ceases if you lose mental capacity. Typically these might be used if you are taking an extended trip/holiday and you want someone to manage things back at home for you. An Enduring Power of Attorney continues even if you become incapacitated, making it essential for future planning. We typically recommend Enduring Powers of Attorney for comprehensive protection. Your attorney is able to make decisions with regard to you financial and legal matters.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>An Enduring Guardian makes personal and lifestyle decisions (health, accommodation, services) if you lose capacity, while an Enduring Power of Attorney handles financial matters. Both documents work together to ensure trusted people can make all necessary decisions on your behalf.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Choose someone trustworthy, reliable, and preferably younger than you. Consider their ability to handle financial matters or make personal decisions (particularly about your health and end of life) as required. You can appoint the same person for both roles or different people. We can advise on the pros and cons of each approach.</p>

                        <p>Powers of Attorney can take effect immediately or when you lose capacity, depending on how they're prepared. Enduring Guardian appointments only take effect when you lose capacity. We'll explain the options and help you choose what is appropriate for your circumstances.</p>

                        <p>Yes, you can revoke or change Powers of Attorney (both General and Enduring) and Enduring Guardian appointments at any time while you have mental capacity to do so.
