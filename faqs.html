                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Do I really need a will?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Absolutely. Without a valid will, NSW intestacy laws determine how your assets are distributed, which may not align with your wishes. A will ensures your loved ones are provided for according to your intentions and can significantly reduce stress and costs for your family during an already difficult time.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What makes Wilsons Solicitors' will preparation different?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Our unique interactive visual presentation system allows you to see your will being created in real-time during your appointment. Led by David Wilson, a post-graduate qualified Estate Planning Lawyer, you'll fully understand and approve every aspect of your will before signing. This ensures complete confidence and eliminates confusion.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">How often should I update my will?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Review your will every 3-5 years or after major life events such as marriage, divorce, birth of children, significant asset changes, or moving interstate. We recommend keeping your will current to ensure it reflects your current circumstances and wishes.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Can I write my own will using a kit?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>While legally possible, DIY wills carry significant risks. Improper execution, unclear language, or failure to meet legal requirements can make your will invalid or lead to unintended consequences. Professional legal advice ensures your will is properly drafted, executed, and legally sound.</p>

                    <div class="faq-question">What happens if I don't have a will?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>If you die without a valid will (intestate), NSW law determines how your assets are distributed. This may not reflect your wishes and can result in lengthy, expensive court processes. Your spouse and children receive assets according to a predetermined formula, regardless of your actual intentions.</p>
                    </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">How much does will preparation cost?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Our will preparation services use transparent, fixed-fee pricing so you know exactly what to expect. Costs vary depending on complexity, but we believe everyone should have access to proper estate planning. Contact us for a no-obligation quote tailored to your specific needs.</p>

            <!-- Probate & Administration FAQs -->
            <div id="probate-faq" class="faq-content">
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What is probate and when is it required?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Probate is the legal process of validating a will and granting authority to the executor to administer the deceased's estate. It's required when someone dies leaving assets in their sole name, such as real estate, bank accounts, or shares. Assets held jointly or with nominated beneficiaries typically don't require probate.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">How long does probate take?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Probate timeframes vary depending on the complexity of the estate and court processing times. Simple estates may take 6-8 weeks for probate approval, while complex estates can take several months. The full estate administration process typically takes 6-12 months to complete.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">Why don't you charge percentage-based fees?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>We believe in fair, transparent pricing. Unlike firms that charge a percentage of the estate value (which can result in excessive fees for larger estates), we charge reasonable hourly rates. This ensures you pay for the work actually performed, not an arbitrary percentage of your inheritance.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What are my responsibilities as an executor?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>As an executor, you're responsible for gathering and valuing assets, paying debts and taxes, and distributing the estate according to the will. This includes obtaining probate, lodging tax returns, and keeping detailed records. We guide executors through each step and handle the legal complexities.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Yes, we regularly assist executors and administrators with estates involving assets located interstate or overseas. Our experience includes coordinating with foreign solicitors, navigating different legal systems, and ensuring compliance with international requirements.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What does conveyancing involve?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Conveyancing is the legal process of transferring property ownership from seller to buyer. It involves contract preparation and review, property searches, mortgage coordination, settlement arrangements, and ensuring all legal requirements are met for a valid transfer of title.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">How long does conveyancing take?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Typical conveyancing takes 8-12 weeks from contract to settlement, depending on factors like mortgage approval times, search results, and whether there's a property chain involved. We work efficiently to meet your desired settlement timeframes while ensuring all legal requirements are satisfied.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What are conveyancing searches and why are they important?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Property searches reveal important information about the property including planning restrictions, environmental issues, infrastructure charges, and any other matters that could affect your purchase. These searches protect you from unexpected issues and help ensure you're making an informed decision.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What's included in your flat fee conveyancing service?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Our flat fee covers all standard conveyancing work including contract review, property searches, liaison with banks and other parties, preparation of settlement documents, and attendance at settlement. You'll know the exact cost upfront with no hidden charges or surprise fees.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">When should I engage a conveyancer?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Engage a conveyancer as soon as you're serious about buying or selling property, ideally before signing any contracts. Early engagement allows us to review contracts, advise on terms and conditions, and ensure you're fully protected throughout the transaction process.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <div class="faq-question">What happens at settlement?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Settlement is when ownership officially transfers. We handle all settlement documents, coordinate with banks and other parties, ensure funds are properly transferred, and arrange for keys to be released. You'll receive confirmation once settlement is complete and the property is legally yours.</p>

                    <div class="faq-question">What's the difference between General and Enduring Powers of Attorney?</div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>A General Power of Attorney is temporary and ceases if you lose mental capacity. An Enduring Power of Attorney continues even if you become incapacitated, making it essential for future planning. We typically recommend Enduring Powers of Attorney for comprehensive protection.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>An Enduring Guardian makes personal and lifestyle decisions (health, accommodation, services) if you lose capacity, while an Enduring Power of Attorney handles financial matters. Both documents work together to ensure trusted people can make all necessary decisions on your behalf.</p>

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Choose someone trustworthy, reliable, and preferably younger than you. Consider their ability to handle financial matters or make personal decisions as required. You can appoint the same person for both roles or different people. We can advise on the pros and cons of each approach.</p>

                        <p>Powers of Attorney can take effect immediately or when you lose capacity, depending on how they're prepared. Enduring Guardian appointments only take effect when you lose capacity. We'll explain the options and help you choose what's appropriate for your circumstances.</p>

                        <p>Yes, you can revoke or change Powers of Attorney and Enduring Guardian appointments at any time while you have mental capacity. We recommend reviewing these documents regularly and updating them if your circumstances or preferences change.</p>
